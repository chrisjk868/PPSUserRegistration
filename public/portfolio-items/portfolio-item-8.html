            <p>在狭义相对论的理论之中，我们通常会把时间当成一种典型的参数。虽然日常
                生活跟理论物理的世界差异不少，我还是觉的这种对待时间的态度非常健康。特别在
                忙碌之中，很容易让每天的小烦恼挡住我们的大图思维。其实，每个人生路程是独特的，因此我们只能渐渐旳把今天的事情踏踏实实的做好，希望明天能够做得更好。无
                论遇到多种困难，从 A 点到 B 点都会有可穿越的路径。</p>
            <p>In special relativity, it is typical to view time as an index parameter to be summed
                over on equal footing as the x, y, z or however many dimensions that we are working in. In
                my opinion, this shouldn’t be restricted to the confines of theoretical physics but should be
                widely adopted as a way of tackling and modelling the twists and turns of life. It’s very easy
                to get caught up in “bubbles” where real world constraints can get in the way of managing
                our energies effectively; In times like this it’s beneficial to use local information to patch
                together a global image of how to parameterize a trajectory most efficiently over our current
                landscape. Indeed, encountering cusps or regions of pathological undifferentiability might
                seem impenetrable at first, but in a simply connected space there will always be a path from
                A to B.</p>
            <p>
                More importantly, having time as an extra parameter in our life provides us with the
flexibility to choose not only where and how, but when. We often set arbitrary parameters for
ourselves to achieve certain milestones at certain ages, but these are well, arbitrary. Of
course, to accomplish anything in life requires some sort of time-pressure, but there is no
reason why we can’t take advantage of the fact that even though it marches ever forward,
time is malleable. I can decide to eat dinner an hour later today to finish a piece of work that I
am currently immensely inspired to work on, which won’t necessarily be the case after I eat
dinner. So long as all necessary tasks are accomplished within a reasonable time frame (for
example, eating at some point soon so that I don’t starve to death), we have immense power
over how we choose to let the parameter of time govern our lives.
</p>

<p>
Really what I wanted to emphasize is that time is on your side. There will always be time to
do the things you really want to do, and to do the things you believe in, so long as you make
time for it. There is no reason to be constrained simply by the way your friends and family
work with time, your own relationship with time is truly unique. As with any relationship,
you want to treasure it – there is no good reason to “kill time”, or to say that “there is not
enough time”, that’s like killing a friendship or saying that your relationship is insufficient to
satisfy your needs. For things to work out, both sides need to put in the effort, and time truly
never fails to meet your needs when you really try. So, will you try fruitlessly to control time,
passively let it control you – or reverentially befriend it?
